# GreenView
  
     A feature that helps SnapChat users participate in community engagements through events 
     and community chat to protect their environment.
  
# Problem
    Gen Z is passionate about environmental sustainability, but finding community events
    to engage with can be very draining, demotivating them from actively trying to help. 

# Mission and Goals
     Our mission  is to help Gen z become more aware of environmental conscious events in their proximity. 
     Our goal is to simplify the process of volunteers finding community engagement events.
     We hope to increase Gen Z participation rate from 32% to 40% within 9-12 months.
